      <br>
      <img src = "images/hangman.png" style="width: 248px; height: 298px;">
      <p style="font-size: 18px;">rachel and i recreated hangman, with the winning word being duck. if you guess the wrong letter, it draws a body part. if you guess a correct letter, it fills it in an empty space until you get the correct word. this is an instance where the game was won.</p>

      <img src = "images/pokemon.png" style="width: 300px; height: 282px;">
      <p style="font-size: 18px;">aadit and i created a pokemon catching game in which the objective is to catch as many pokemon as possible before the time runs out. you click 'e' to catch the pokemon, but you'll only be able to catch them if they're nearby. a leaderboard is displayed at the end, and the goal is to place first.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 18px;">kat and i created a mouse maze game on scratch. first, you type in your name and design your character. then, you try to grab as many cheese puffs as you can by completing the maze. after a minute, you will receive a score based on the number of cheese puffs you collected.</p>

      <p>project #6: rover phone home ü¶î</p>
      <br>
      <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRybzGM8LYOccUEFrGfI2T1bPqvGvrumxhskTUFckEhbdP0-HBTE9uAiXoYZrMY8NRVhhsrjnOz-bTe/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width="960" height="569" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
      <p style="font-size: 18px;">we concluded that the rover was lost in a forest as the data showed smooth temperatures changes, constant sounds with some peaks (indicating thunder), low light conditions, and small rocking in the data.</p>
